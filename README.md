# Arduino-Car
This project enables remote control of an Arduino-based car through a web interface. A Flask server is used to relay commands between the web interface and an Arduino connected via serial communication.
* **For this code, you need Arduino IDE and a compiler for Python.**
# Requirements
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need this hardware and software for do this proyect
  *  Hardware
        * Arduino board (compatible with the pins defined in the code).
        * Motor driver module (e.g., L298N or similar).
        * DC motors.
        * USB connection for Arduino communication.
  *  Software:
       * Arduino IDE
       * Python 3.9 or higher.
       * Flask (pip install flask)
       * Serial communication library: pyserial (pip install pyserial).
# Dependencies
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to download the dependencies for the configuration to work.
* This is for the dependecies for the python code.
<pre>pip install flask pyserial</pre>
* The code for Arduino doesn't need dependencies.
